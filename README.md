OMG, just finished watching Lilo & Stitch again, and I swear it hits different every time. Like, how does Disney always nail these feels? 🤯 Stitch's chaos energy is literally my spirit animal right now. And poor Lilo, omg, talk about kid goals and struggle. Her hula dance at the end? I'm not crying, you're crying. Well, maybe a little teary-eyed here, haha.

But honestly, I’m so tired. Why does watching a movie feel like running a marathon sometimes? I was just trying to download the movie to get that nostalgia rush, and then bam, emotional rollercoaster. Seriously, how do they pack all that into one movie?

> Bro, when Lilo said Ohana means family, I literally got chills. LIKE, BETCHA DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE CRYING OVER A BLUE ALIEN TODAY, DID YOU? Stitch being all wild and then just wanting to be loved... it's just a whole mood. Also, anyone else feel like Nani is low-key one of the best Disney characters? She just holds it all together with, like, pure willpower. Mad respect, tbh.

Remembering I had to like, actually watch the movie when I could've just skimmed through it made me feel like I was actually pulling a task, not chilling. 😅 now I’m here thinking about how weird it would be to have your own Stitch. Total mayhem but some wicked fun, right?

function downloadMovie() { return “why am I a part of this conversation?”; }

Anyway, my head's buzzing with “I don't wanna adult” vibes. Need more coffee or sleep or something. Maybe next on the list is another feel-good classic. Or not, coz my eyes might melt already. Catch ya later! 👋
